> TAEML: Task-Adaptive Ensemble of Meta-Leaners for Few-shot Classification
### **How to Use**

```bash
Abstract
Most of meta-learning methods assume that a set of tasks in the meta-training
phase is sampled from a single dataset. Thus, when a new task is drawn from
another dataset, the performance of meta-learning methods is degraded. To alleviate
this effect, we introduce a task-adaptive ensemble network that aggregates metalearners
by putting more weights on the learners that are expected to perform
well to the given task. Experiments demonstrate that our task-adaptive ensemble
significantly outperforms previous meta-learners and their uniform averaging.
